My one sole concern is the Ô£ø Watch app. It refuses to load any of my balances, and instead completely crashed upon launch. I‚Äôve tried restarting my watch, uninstalling and reinstalling the watch app, and even updating my watch to a beta version of WatchOS. None of these have solved my issue. Please look into your watch app! I often times find it easier to check balances on my wrist rather than pull my phone out. 

Thanks for a great app nonetheless.

EDIT: Followed the steps detailed in the developer reply and the watch app still does not work. Honestly, I think this might be because I‚Äôm using beta versions of WatchOS and iOS. I do recall the watch app working even on earlier beta versions though...very weird. I appreciate BOA reaching out and replying to my review.",2019-03-14

My wife gets a push notification on her iPhone every time her Capital One card is charged.

Capital One‚Äôs mobile app is also more intuitive, user friendly, and visually appealing than this app. 

Specifically, the Erica virtual assistant in this BoA app is pretty useless and I quickly figured out how to disable it and hide its annoying always-on-screen icon. Discover‚Äôs 24 hour Messaging feature with a real person through the app is one of the best support services I have ever used. 

The app takes 20 seconds to open and login, even with Touch ID to authenticate instantly and fast internet. This isn‚Äôt too much longer than other bank apps, but it is just long enough to make me dread opening the app. 

Setting up automatic full-statement monthly payments is way clunkier and more of a hassle than it should be. I actually never even figured out if it was possible to do through the app, and I finally figured out how to set this up on the website through e-Bills or something. It‚Äôs almost like they don‚Äôt want you to pay the full balance on time. 

I do like the new 3% cash back in category of your choice deal. I haven‚Äôt had my first statement, though, so the app and website won‚Äôt let me see what cash back rewards are available. Not sure why they are hiding this.
